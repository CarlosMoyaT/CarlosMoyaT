I am a passionate software developer with a strong interest in backend engineering and clean code principles. I enjoy solving complex problems and building well-structured, maintainable applications.

My main focus is on the Java ecosystem, where I work with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Spring Security to develop modern applications. I have practical experience designing microservices architectures, applying asynchronous communication with Apache Kafka, and implementing authentication and access management with Keycloak.

I also enjoy working on projects where observability and reliability are important, having used tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, and Docker for containerization and scalability.
